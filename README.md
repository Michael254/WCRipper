WannaCry 2.0 Vaccine

First World WannaCry 2.0 Vaccine.

v1.0 features:

+Added firewall blocks to prevent WC2.0 from spreding to your computer and using your computer to spread to the network.
+Added feature to stop WC2.0 from using the known Windows security flaw to install and spread itself.

I do not guaratee that it will work for ever, but for now it may be the solution to protect some computers and servers.
