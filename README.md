WannaCry 2.0 Vaccine

First World WannaCry 2.0 Vaccine.
v1.0 features:
+Added firewall blocks to prevent WC2.0 from spreding to your computer and using your computer to spread to the network.
+Added feature to stop WC2.0 from using the known Windows security flaw to install and spread itself.

I do not guaratee that it will work for ever, but for now it may be the solution to protect some computers and servers.

Why i will not release the source code?
A: Because last time i made a useful project a guy copied my code, got 2 interviews using MY CODE and got 2 million downloads and the credits.
